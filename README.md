# SPATIALINTEL
A Real-Time Neural Radiance Field–Based 3D Scene Reconstruction and Language-Driven Spatial Reasoning. Build a system that reconstructs a 3D environment from smartphone video using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and enables natural-language scene understanding via object detection, spatial reasoning, and Large Language Models (LLMs).
